This week's learning focus was working with PyTorch and building custom neural networks with PyTorch, I was able to code a custom neural network.  https://github.com/cyberholics/200-days-of-machine-learning/blob/main/NoteBooks/neural_network_intro.ipynb

I also committed time to writing an article: https://dev.to/cyber_holics/why-you-shouldnt-contribute-to-open-source-104l
